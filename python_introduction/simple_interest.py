# basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
time = 3

# solving simple interest

interest = principal * rate * time

# print result

print("The simple interest is:", interest)
